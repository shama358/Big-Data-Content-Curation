# Big Data Content Curation

Developed a Big Data Content Curtation application as an under-grad project in 2013-2014, using java. The output of this application was pulled into excel sheets for visualization.

This application has a number of use cases. I identified and worked around 2 use-cases.

1. Parsing huge volume of enterprise server logs to get insights as to why the server crashed or has conflicts. Analysing the output of the server logs can help the engineers to find the issue quickly compared to the time required to analyse the entire server logs.

2. Analysing a social networking dump to find what is trending. This can further have multiple use cases, for eg: a Brand can find how many times are the customers using the Brand name, for what purpose and their sentiment towards the brand.
